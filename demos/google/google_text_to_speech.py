#
# This demo will join a Daily meeting and, given a text file with senteces (one
# per line), will translate text into audio using Google Text-To-Speech API and
# will send it into the meeting.
#
# The demo requires Google Speech-To-Text credentials.
#
# See https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin
#
# Usage: python3 google_speech_to_text.py -m MEETING_URL -i FILE
