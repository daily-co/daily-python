# Daily Client SDK for Python

> **Looking to develop voice and video agents?**
> 
> We recommend using [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat). Daily Python is too low-level for most consumer-facing apps.

The Daily client SDK for Python allows you to build video and audio calling into your native desktop and server applications.

![daily-python](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-python/blob/main/daily-python.gif?raw=true)

This SDK is well suited to build AI applications on the server side as it can be
easily integrated with well-known Python libraries such as
[OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python),
[Deepgram](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk),
[YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org),
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and much more.

The SDK's core features include:

- Joining a Daily meeting as a participant
- As a meeting participant, configuring inputs, publishing, and subscription settings
- Receiving video frames from other participants
- Receiving raw audio from all participants in the meeting
- Sending video into a meeting
- Sending raw audio into a meeting

This functionality can be applied to several AI use cases, including:

- Performing object or face detection on the server side
- Processing audio from a Speech-To-Text platform into a meeting
- Sending audio from a Text-To-Speech platform into a meeting
- Sending video and audio tracks to a content moderation platform
- Using generative AI to inject video content into a meeting
